Program 1: Given a set of string, make the first letter of string capital and rest small.
Program 2: Given a set of number, count even no of element and odd number of element and 
print there sum individually.
Example: 1,2,3,4,8,6
Output: even: 4 sum: 20 odd:2 sum:4
Program 3: Given a set of string sort them length wise.Eliminate duplicate string.
Program 4: Given a set of string sort them in Alphabetically order.Eleminate duplicate string.
Program 5: Find the smallest and largest element in a set of string.
Program 6: Find smallest and largest number in set of number.
Program 7: Write a loop that swaps adjacent elements of an array of integers. For example,
Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) becomes Array(2, 1, 4, 3, 5).
PROGRAM 8:Given an array of integers, produce a new array that contains all positive
values of the original array, in their original order, followed by all values that
are zero or negative, in their original order.
Program 9: Suppose you are given an array buffer of integers and want to remove all the number after
you encountered first negative number.Wen you encounter an negative number remove all the
element after that. Ex: [1,2,5,6,-1,2,3]=> [1,2,5,6] [1,-2,3,4] => [1] [-3,4,5]=>[]
